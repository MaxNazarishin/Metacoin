This repository contains an example of a crypto wallet website. The site will be finalized in the future (I take it as an exam paper).The site is written using the Angular framework.

To run my project, you must first download my file. 
Here is an example of how to download the file: 
1) Click on the "code" button.
2) Select "HTTPS" and copy the link. 
3) Download "git bash" from the official website.
4) Right-click on the location where you want to install my project (for example, on your desktop).
5) Select "Open git bash here".
6) Write "git clone" in the console.
7) After the space after the word "clone", right-click on the console area and select "Paste", the link you copied to the Git hub will be pasted.
8) Press the "Enter" button on the keyboard.
9) Open Visual Studio Code.
10) Paste the folder into Visual Studio Code.
11) Open a terminal and write "cd MetaCoin".
12) Write "npm i".
